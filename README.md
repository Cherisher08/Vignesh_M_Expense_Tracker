## Documentation

The website provides mock-up data for weather forecasts in different locations across the world. It displays real-time, weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, precipitation and so on and different customizations of the data displayed. The website has three different sections to display the data in various forms.

### Top-Section | City-Specific detailed Weather Condition Display

This section consists of a drop-down menu that allows the user to interact with it in order to choose a city of their choice. Detailed weather forecasts are displayed for the chosen city throughout the top section. It also displays a timeline scale for showing the forecasted weather for the next five hours of time in the chosen city. This could help the user to plan their schedule accordingly.[Fig.1.1]

This section consists of customized card-like fields that shows minimal weather conditions for all cities to which the data is available. It has a menu bar with options to select top cities that do match the criteria for a specific weather condition. We can also limit the number of cities to listed or shown.[Fig.1.2]
